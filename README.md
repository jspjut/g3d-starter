This repository is meant as an example of how to create a [G3D](https://casual-effects.com/g3d/www/index.html) starter project without having to modify your global visual studio user settings. 

The gist of the change from the default G3D starter is in [this changelist](https://github.com/jspjut/g3d-starter/commit/e1a78a0a012d021bf24d03513d681c1e62f61330).

You could also just copy this repository (mostly just the vcxproj and sln) to start your own project.
